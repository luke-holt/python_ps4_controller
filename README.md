This was a fun experiment I did because I was procrastinating instead of studying to write my exams. Might keep going, might not. 

Am not very good at Object-Oriented Programming, so this might be a fun project to get better at that.

I learned how to connect read input from my PS4 controller using python. Could have applications for easy robotics interface.
